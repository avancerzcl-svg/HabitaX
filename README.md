&nbsp;***About me***

Avancerz presents HabitaX, an interactive 3D simulator developed in Unity that allows users to design, expand, and analyze modular habitats for the Moon and Mars. 
The project is based on real NASA data concerning oxygen, water, and energy requirements, complemented by synthetic food variables to simulate complete life-support scenarios. 
Each habitat module—modeled using Autodesk Inventor—was designed following NASA’s volume specifications, ensuring efficient use of space, protection, and structural adaptability.
The simulator calculates efficiency and sustainability levels, helping users visualize how design decisions impact long-term resource consumption. Beyond simulation, HabitaX seeks 
to serve as an educational and research tool that connects scientific knowledge with accessible learning. By integrating real data into an interactive environment, Avancerz aims to inspire 
innovation and prepare future generations to imagine, design, and build sustainable habitats for life beyond Earth.
